- Check the datasets [X]
- task 2 & 3 well see the who dataset [X]
- improve pred task 2 and 3 - task 1 NO == 1 [X]
   - remove these sample to no confuse tge LLM during fine-tune
- Normalize output layers task 2 input/output [X]
- add NO to the output save file [X]
- range of the metric (documentation) [X]
- clean the all training scripts [X]

- preper script to run in 2 gpu
- get valeus for training MAX_LEN, BATCH_SIZE

- write the test script
  - take into account NO == 1 task1 for the other tasks
  - join NO value the final predictions [X]





Giulia
script
- agregate predictions - diferente LLM
- aproximate preds to possible values
